# PokemonAPI
*This project was created as a tutorial and template to teach my brother back end web app development and general coding practices.*

## ~ A tribute to the first 151 pokemon from Bulbasaur to Mew ~
#### The function of this Back End server is to query the poekapi.co API requesting information for the original 151. With the data response from pokeapi, the data is then filtered and assigned to pokemon models that will only contain the data about the pokemon that will be displayed in the Front End (ex: Name, Stats, Description, Image)
